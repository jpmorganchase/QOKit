This repository contains fast CPU and GPU simulators for benchmarking the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, as well as scripts for generating matching quantum circuits for execution on hardware. See the [examples](./examples) folder for a demo of this package and check out the [blog post](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/technology-blog/quantum-optimization-research) describing the simulators.

### Install

Creating a virtual environment is recommended before installing.
```
python -m venv qokit
source qokit/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
```

Install requires `python>=3.9` and `pip >= 23`. It is recommended to update your pip using `pip install --upgrade pip` before install.

```
git clone https://github.com/jpmorganchase/QOKit.git
cd QOKit/
pip install -e .
```

Some optional parts of the package require additional dependencies. 
- GPU simulation: `pip install -e .[GPU-CUDA12]`
- Generating LP files to solve LABS using commercial IP solvers (`qokit/classical_methods` and `examples/advanced/classical_solvers_for_LABS/`): `pip install -e .[solvers]`

Please note that the GPU dependency is specified for CUDA 12x. For other versions of CUDA, please follow cupy installation instructions.

If compilation fails, try installing just the Python version using `QOKIT_PYTHON_ONLY=1 pip install -e .`.

Installation can be verified by running tests using `pytest`.

#### MaxCut

For MaxCut, the datasets in `qokit/assets/maxcut_datasets` must be inflated
