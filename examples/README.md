# QOKit usage examples

Welcome to QOKit examples. We show how to use QOKit for two combinatorial problems as well as for a general problem. We also provide a couple of advanced usage examples.

- [`QAOA_LABS_optimization.ipynb`](./QAOA_LABS_optimization.ipynb) - Optimize parameters of QAOA for LABS problem, extrapolating from smaller known p as initial optimization guess.
- [`QAOA_portfolio_optimization.ipynb`](./QAOA_portfolio_optimization.ipynb) - Optimize parameters of QAOA for financial portfolio optimization problem.
- [`advanced`](./advanced/) folder gives hands-on examples for particular experimental purpose.
- [`QOKit_general_simulation.ipynb`](./QOKit_general_simulation.ipynb) - Example of using QOKit for arbitary QAOA problem of your preference and more details on simulation.
